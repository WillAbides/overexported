Usage: overexported <packages> ... [flags]

The overexported command reports exported identifiers that could be unexported.

The overexported command loads a Go program from source then uses Rapid Type Analysis (RTA) to
build a call graph of all the functions reachable from the program's main function. Any exported
identifiers (functions, types, methods, variables, and constants) that are not referenced from
outside their package are reported as over-exported, grouped by package.

Packages are expressed in the notation of 'go list' (or other underlying build system if you
are using an alternative golang.org/x/go/packages driver). Only executable (main) packages are
considered starting points for the analysis.

The --test flag causes it to analyze test executables too. Tests sometimes make use of identifiers
that would otherwise appear to be over-exported, and public API identifiers reported as
over-exported with --test indicate possible gaps in your test coverage or truly unnecessary exports.

The --filter flag restricts results to packages that match the provided regular expression;
its default value is the special string "<module>" which matches the listed packages and any other
packages belonging to the same modules. Use --filter= to display all results.

Example: show all over-exported identifiers within a module:

    $ overexported --test ./...

By default, the tool does not report exports in generated files, as determined by the special
comment described in https://go.dev/s/generatedcode . Use the --generated flag to include them.

Just because an identifier is reported as over-exported does not mean it is unconditionally safe
to unexport it. For example, an over-exported function may be referenced by another over-exported
function. Some judgement is required.

The analysis is valid only for a single GOOS/GOARCH configuration, so an identifier reported as
over-exported may be used in a different configuration. Consider running the tool once for each
configuration of interest.

Arguments:
  <packages> ...    Package patterns to analyze.

Flags:
  -h, --help                 Show context-sensitive help.
  -C, --chdir=STRING         Change to this directory before running.
      --test                 Include test packages and executables in the analysis.
      --generated            Include exports in generated Go files.
      --json                 Output JSON records.
      --filter="<module>"    Report only packages matching this regular expression. '<module>'
                             matches the modules of all analyzed packages.
